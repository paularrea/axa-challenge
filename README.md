# WELCOME TO THE GNOME FINDER APP

Somebody told me how busy the AXA heroes are at the moment. That's why I create a very easy to use responsive web application to help them on their adventure.
Here you'll find the repo : (https://github.com/paularrea/axa-challenge)

I hope you like it!

## FEATURES

This is a mobile first app made with React hooks and SASS. Redux and its middleware Redux saga have been used in the project to manage state operations.

### Home page

Intro text with button that sends you to /population and api filtration components.

### Population page

Gnomes list displayed in diferent pages to avoid long operations. By clicking the gnomes cards you are able to see the details of each one.

libraries used: react-flexbox-grid, react-paginate

### Statistics page

Some graphs to have a better visualization of some characteristics of the gnomes. The first graph is a pie chart that divides the gnomes by their hair color. The second graph is a bar chart representing the population divided by age ranges.

libraries used: recharts

### `npm i`

In the project directory, you can run <i>npm i</i> to install all dependencies.
